The bibliograhy is searched in the folder of the document, and then 
in ~/Documents.

References can use different styles such as: (Lane 2000) or
Lane (2000).

Page numbers can be added: (Lane 2000, 89) or Lane (2000, 89-93).

A bit of pretext can be included too: (See Lane 2000, 89)

We can include other files, which are also processed:

include::/home/peter/Code/Ruby/asciidoc-bib/samples/sample-2-ref.txt[]

Simple ref [1]

To include the reference list, use the section template before
