The bibliography is searched in the folder of the document, and then 
in ~/Documents.

Author-year references can use different styles such as: cite:[Lane12b] or
citenp:[Lane12a].

Page numbers can be added: cite:[Lane12a(89)] or citenp:[Lane12a(89-93)].

A bit of pretext can be included too: See cite:[Lane12a(89)]

We can include other files, which are also processed:

include::sample-2.txt[]

To include the reference list, use the section template before
title, to prevent problems with a2x.
