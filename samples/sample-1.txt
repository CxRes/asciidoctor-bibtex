The bibliography is searched in the folder of the document, and then 
in ~/Documents.

Author-year references can use different styles such as: [cite:Lane12a] or
[citenp:Lane12a].

Page numbers can be added: [cite:Lane12a,89] or [citenp:Lane12a,89-93].

A bit of pretext can be included too: [cite:See:Lane12a,89]

We can include other files, which are also processed:

include::sample-2.txt[]

To include the reference list, use the section template before
title, to prevent problems with a2x.
